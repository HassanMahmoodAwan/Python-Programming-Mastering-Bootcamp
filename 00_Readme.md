### Python:
- Python is a High Level Language which provided both Functional and Object Oriented Approach.
- Used for Backend Development, Game Development, Desktop App, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence Programming, Data Scraping and Data Analysis .
- Its one of fastest growing language and popular due to Machine Learning and AI.


### About this Repo:
1. Mastering Python
2. Developing Problem Solving Skills
3. Learning Build-in Data Structures
4. Programming with Object oriented Approach
5. Learning File Handling
6. Developing lots of Projects
6. Working with 2-D Arrays using Numpy
7. Handling Data and Finding UseFull Insights with Pandas
6. Writing Clean, Tested and Readable Code

### Python external and Build-in Libraries

> For Coding we will be Using __Pycharm__ or __VS Code__.<br />
> Need to install external Libraries for that <br />
> - eg: pip install numpy

Python Builtin important Libraries Include
- OS
- time


### Python Virtual Envirnment
For this Repo creating a Virtual Environment venv, as Its dependencies and Packages will be independent of global libraries. <br />
>  - python -m venv venv_name <br />
>  - venv_name/Scripts/activate <br />

To deactivate venv: <br />
> - deactivate


### Unique Concepts:
- Unicode and ord().
- Input Separated in two variables.
- from typing import list.
- list1 is list2  ? answer?
- function overloading -> muiltipledispatch
- placement of default parameter
- map(int, input().split(" "))

## Certifications in Python:


### Python for Data Science, Ai and Development
Completed form IBM offered by Coursera.
